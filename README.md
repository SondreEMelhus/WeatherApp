# WeatherApp

This is a work-in-progress project where I am creating a weather forecast web page, using React single page app. The data used in the application is going to be supplied by WeatherApi (link: https://api.met.no/) via fetch, but the current implementation has not yet implemented this, and instead uses a static database of locations.

TODO:

- Implement live weather updates using WeatherApi

- Implement hourly and daily forecasts

- Implement dynamic searchbar (supplies location suggestions based on user-input)

- Implement escaping of user-input

- Improve usability

- Improve application styling 

- Refactoring code (improved readability, more elegant solutions etc)
